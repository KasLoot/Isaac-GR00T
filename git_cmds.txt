push updates to my fork
    # Push your committed changes to your 'origin' remote (your fork)
    git push origin <branch-name>

    # For example, to push the 'main' branch:
    git push origin main

clone to a new machine
    # Get the URL from the "Code" button on your forked repo's GitHub page
    git clone <your-fork-url>


Pull updates from the original repo and merge
    # Get the URL from the original repository's GitHub page
    git remote add upstream <original-repo-url>

    # Verify that it was added
    git remote -v
    # You should now see both 'origin' and 'upstream' listed

Fetch the latest updates from the original repo:
    # This downloads the latest changes from the 'upstream' remote
    git fetch upstream

Merge the updates into your local branch:
    make sure you are on the branch you want to update (e.g., main).
    git checkout main

    merge the changes from the original repo's corresponding branch
    # This merges the 'main' branch from 'upstream' into your current local 'main' branch
    git merge upstream/main

Push the merged updates to your fork
    git push origin main
